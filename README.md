# 2048 AI Game Enhancement

This repository hosts an advanced version of the 2048 game, incorporating various AI algorithms to optimize gameplay and strategy.

## Features

- **AI Strategies**: Implementation of different AI strategies based on metrics like smoothness, monotonicity, and tile placement.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - `smoothness`: Measures how smoothly the numbers progress in adjacent tiles.
  - `monotonicity`: Ensures numbers are monotonically increasing or decreasing in rows and columns.
  - `emptyCellNum`: Counts the number of empty cells.
  - `isBigTileInCorner`: Checks if the largest tile is strategically placed in a corner.
  - `biggerTilesOnBoarderPreference`: Prefers larger tiles on the board's edges.
- **Input Modes**:
  - Automatic tile placement by the computer.
  - Manual control for inserting a 2 or 4.
